# Automated-Detection-of-Pneumonia-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images
Pneumonia is a life-threatening lung infection requiring early diagnosis. Manual X-ray analysis is time-consuming, subjective, and resource-intensive, creating a need for automated solutions.

**Objective**
This project aims to build a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images into "Pneumonia" or "Normal" categories, assisting healthcare professionals in rapid diagnosis.

**Dataset Details**
● Dataset Name: Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)
● Structure: The dataset contains 5,863 images split into train,validation and test folders. Each category has two subfolders: PNEUMONIA and NORMAL
● Class distribution:
- Pneumonia: 4,275 images
- Normal: 1,583 images

Model used: CNN
CNNs excel at image processing by automatically detecting spatial hierarchies (edges → textures → patterns → objects) through convolutional layers.
